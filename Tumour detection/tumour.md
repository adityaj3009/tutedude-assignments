# ðŸ§  Tumor Detection Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to classify tumors as **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using a machine learning model also train dataset. It is a part of Module 14 and involves real-world medical data analysis and predictive modeling.

## ðŸ”§ What We Did
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset (removed ID and unnamed columns).
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using count plots and a correlation heatmap.
- Preprocessed the data using **StandardScaler**.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** using sklearn.
- Evaluated model performance using **accuracy**.

## ðŸ“Š Visuals Included
- Countplot showing distribution of tumor types
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Accuracy of the final model

## âœ… Final Outcome
Achieved a high accuracy in predicting whether a tumor is benign or malignant using Random Forest.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
