# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction Project

**Module 13: Machine Learning - Linear Regression**  
**Assignment 6 - Predicting Precipitation with Austin Weather Data**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **precipitation levels** using various weather features from the **Austin Weather dataset**. You'll explore the relationships between attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, and learn how they influence rainfall.

The goal is to:
- Clean and preprocess real-world weather data.
- Apply **Linear Regression** using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualize and analyze weather patterns affecting precipitation.
- Build a simple yet effective rainfall prediction model.

## 🧠 Key Skills Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Handling missing values and symbols like `"T"` (trace) and `"-"`
- Data Visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Linear Regression Modeling (`sklearn`)


## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns and converted non-numeric values.
2. **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and formatted numerical data.
3. **Feature Selection**: Selected weather attributes that impact rainfall.
4. **Model Building**: Applied **Linear Regression** to predict precipitation.
5. **Visualization**: Plotted trends and relationships to understand dependencies.

## 📊 Results
The model shows how weather attributes affect rainfall and provides a basic prediction mechanism. Visual graphs help explain the correlation between different parameters and precipitation levels.
